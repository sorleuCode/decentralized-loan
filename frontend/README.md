# LumenVault, A micro-loan with Interest

### Empowering Peer-to-Peer Lending with Blockchain Technology

---

## 🌍Project Overview
*LumenVault* is a decentralized platform designed to facilitate small-scale loans for individuals and businesses, ensuring transparency, security, and accessibility. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform eliminates inefficiencies in traditional lending systems, such as high fees, slow processing times, and lack of inclusivity.

Borrowers can access micro-loans seamlessly, while lenders earn interest in a trustless environment supported by smart contracts on the Pharos blockchain.
